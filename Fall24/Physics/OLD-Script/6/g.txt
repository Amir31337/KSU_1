MYFILES/FALL24/Physics/6th/pytorch$ CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 python3 pytorch-cinnV1.py


based on the attached code, modify python script to resolve the error on order to solve this problem:

the problem is Problem:"Reconstructing Atomic Positions from Coulomb Explosion Data
Simulated behavior of atomic fragments under Coulomb explosion 
Dataset: Initial positions and final momenta of each atom 
Stored in CSV file with labeled columns 
data = pd.read_csv('/home/g/ghanaatian/MYFILES/FALL24/Physics/cei_traning_orient_1.csv')
position = data[['cx', 'cy', 'cz', 'ox', 'oy', 'oz', 'sx', 'sy', 'sz']].values
momenta = data[['pcx', 'pcy', 'pcz', 'pox', 'poy', 'poz', 'psx', 'psy', 'psz']].values
POSITION_DIM = 9 # Dimension of position
MOMENTA_DIM = 9 # Dimension of momenta
Each row represents a single simulated geometry
CSV file structure: Initial Atomic Positions
x, y, z coordinates for Carbon, Oxygen, and Sulfur
Final Atomic Momenta 
px, py, pz for each atom
Input: Final momenta of atoms 

Output: Predicted initial positions of atoms before Coulomb explosion

Inverse problem: Final momentum → Initial atomic positions 
Model must learn relationship between momentum and initial configuration 
Reconstructed positions provide insights into pre-explosion geometry
the model should only use the positions value in training phase and not use any of position's in the test as the model is trying to predict position. so instead of using the value of positions in the test phase it should use the saved representation for predicting position in addition to momenta as a condition!
Latent Representation Saving for training's position
•After training, latent parameters are saved
•Saved parameters will be used for sampling during testing phase
Testing Phase
• Encoder is not used during testing (safeguard against data leakage)
• Latent variables are sampled from the learned distribution in the training
phase
• Decoder uses sampled latent variables along with test momenta (Y) to
predict test positions (X)
pay attention to provide the full script, you have to provide me at once the entire code containing my desired changes!!
