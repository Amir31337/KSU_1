with ‘CEI-training-orient-1.csv’
Which has 10,000 rows, we did
two different approaches based on
the parameters we discussed on Nov 6th.

First was ‘for loop’ approach
That its reports are available in the shared
Excel file.

The second approach was ‘Optuna’ library
Instead of checking every single combination,
the Optuna library simply uses
a probabilistic model to search for possible better
combinations. Instead of grid search,
it uses Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE).
TPE considers the history of searches
and learns patterns to find a possible better
combination. Optuna uses Bayesian probability
to focus on promising areas of hyperparameter
space.

The first approach parameters are in :app1.json & The second approach parameters are in :app1.json.

Then I try to use these hypere-parameters with the new data and used colab and NRP as the needed nearly 40GB GPU. some of combinations give excactly same numbers for a large number of rows so I try to plot every one of all 9 position first with the whole 1M data and then with 150,000 test split and I provided the data distributaion and learning curve for all these hyper-parameters combination and a report of what would be the metrics for these new data.
